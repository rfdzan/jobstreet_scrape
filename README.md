# Jobstreet Job Card Scrape (WIP)
Automating desktop job posting notification

# Why
Filter jobs according to what I seek, reducing it into the most important information.  
Prevent wasting hours of mindless browsing.
# Current Info
```
JobPage { title: "Frontend Developer (ReactJs)", date: "Listed more than one day ago", link: "/id/job/73284037?type=standout&ref=search-standalone" }
JobPage { title: "NodeJS Developers", date: "Listed more than three days ago", link: "/id/job/73206672?type=standout&ref=search-standalone" }
...
```
Next step: Filter out links that are more than `x` days old
